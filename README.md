AppApp
======
AppApp is an iOS app for http://app.net. It was hastily copy pasted together at 3am and should only serve as an example of how to consume the JSON API natively on iOS. The buttons merely print JSON to the console. This should give you a great starting point from which to create your own App.Net iOS App.

##### Why Is This So Ugly?!?! ######
There is a real UI coming, along with a much more flexiable API client, I'm waiting for a handfull of designers on App.Net to come through with PSD's. 

##### Get @me #####
You can find me on App.Net [@sneakyness](http://alpha.app.net/sneakyness), on t[@ataraxia_status](http://twitter.com/ataraxia_status), in the [App.net hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/garqCaGOZ), on irc.freenode.net in #appnet, and by [email](mailto:sneakyness@sneakyness.com). You can also buy me beer in person, if you come to Seattle.
